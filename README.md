Table result:

# Recommendation:
The web is looked attractive now with the header. However, there is a little bit difficult for the visitor to look for the data on the website since the search button is removed. Dana should create a search button again, so visitor can easily search the information that they want to look for. It will be better if there is a map that links with the UFOs location.
